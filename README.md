# Object-Detection-Using-YOLO8

I implemented an object detection system using YOLOv8 to identify people and various Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) items. The system uses custom-trained
YOLOv8 models and includes:

*Converting PascalVOC format XML annotations to YOLO format

*Training a YOLOv8 model on a custom dataset for person detection

*Training a second YOLOv8 model on a custom dataset for PPE detection

*Creating an inference pipeline

*Generating predictions with visualized results showing bounding boxes
